# Usage-Based Discovery Prototype - A simple web application
 
General instructions for set up:

To access the database with the correct credentials contact me at maggieqzhu@yahoo.com. Once you obtain the username and password from me, execute the following commands (replacing 'username' and 'password' with the correct values):

`$ export NEO4J_USERNAME=username`<br />
`$ export NEO4J_PASSWORD=password`<br /><br />

Next up:

- Clone this repository. `$ cd` into the project directory. 
- Create a Python virtual environment with the command `$ virtualenv name-of-env`. 
For simplicity, name it 'venv'. 

- Start up the virtual environment using the following command `$ source venv/bin/activate`.

- Install the required python packages

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run the application

`$ python app.py`

- Browse to http://localhost:5000
